        <p class="info-title">Description</p>
        <p>Sentillum is an invisible and untouchable ghost. To put it simply he does not occupy any
        matter, however he is capable of creating a body with random metal objects around him. Depending
        on which materials he has picked, he can look quite different but most of his forms are humanoid.</p>
        <p>
        It is aggressive but will not attack unless he needs to or when he is in a complete advantage.
        His strength depends on the quality of the materials that make up his body. In his weakest state
        he is just as strong as a human person and in his strongest he is comparable to Godzilla. He
        doesn't need to feed or reproduce.</p>

        <p class="info-title">Story</p>
        <p>After a failed mission Mister Jones Lang has his body mostly erased but attempted to use the flames
            of an Ambustum to revive himself. It is assumed that this procedure transformed him into Sentillum due
            to his first sighting being moments after this.</p>
        <p>
            He tries to hide himself from the public and us so he rarely is ever sighted. He still has the intellect
            from before and uses it fully. He always starts with small scrap parts and then hunts for better and rarer
            metals to grow and improve his body. To achieve his goal he will kidnap and kill anybody necessary.</p>
        <p>
            When having achieved his final body he has communicated with us and stated that he plans on unifying with all
            the creatures in the establishment. He has been dealt with heavy artillery multiple times but we have yet to
            find a way to completely stop him.</p>
        <p>
            He has hinted that through his mutation from human to Sentillum he has gained some knowledge but his goal is
            completely selfish and it has nothing to do with it.</p>

        <p class="info-title">Species</p>
        <p>Sentillum is the only specimen existing from his species. The process that gave birth to him has been repeated
            but he has apparently absorbed the new specimens. As previously stated it is unknown if he can die or if he is
            even alive during his ghost form but all that changes when he begins absorbing metal.</p>
        <p>
            After absorbing the first bit of metal his body will follow normal human laws. He has to feed on energy to keep
            his body going and when part of his body is destroyed, he will feel pain as normal. This also means that when
            upgrading he can't just remove body parts and replace them with newer ones without feeling massive amounts of
            pain.</p>
        <p>
            His combat capabilities are quite high. As mentioned before he starts rather weak but thanks to his intellect he
            can almost always grow strong enough to need anti-tank missiles. In his small humanoid form he is agile and fights
            with sharp objects plus any weapons he can find and in his giant form he is slow but has massive firepower. He can
            also heal by absorbing metal.</p>
