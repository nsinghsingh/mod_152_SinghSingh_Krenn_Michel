        <p>Fulgurs are quadruped creatures made out of clouds and high currents of electricity.
            Their size and shape can vary between a small dog and an entire mountain. The have large
            glowing mouths and glowing eyes which make them easy to spot from afar.</p>
        <p>
            They are highly hostile and will fight anything that they encounter to the death. They are also
            capable of flight. If ever spotted one should seek refuge in the closest building possible
            and aim to stay out of it's sight.</p>

        <p class="info-title">Story</p>
        <p>Fulgurs are mythical creatures which have been mentioned in ancient records and drawings.
            These documents hint to a peaceful relationship between humans and Fulgurs but an unknown
            event occurred which worsened this relationship and led to the disappearance of Fulgurs
            up until now. </p>
        <p>
            All civilians that have encountered this creature have died except for those
            who had the smallest version. As of right now a special combat unit has been deployed
            to kill any medium and above sized Fulgurs in order to avoid a massacre.</p>

        <p>Fulgurs are extremely fast, capable of flight and hurt their enemies by electrocuting them
            or when big enough with water attacks. Since they are made of gas no physical weapon can
            damage them. The only way to defeat them is by reducing the temperature or chemical weapons.</p>
        <p>
            The bigger they are, the more dangerous all of their attacks are. A simple
            electric shock could transform into a deadly 3m wide laser by 200m sized Fulgurs.
            However they can only survive in mist and non-polluted areas. Because of the high pollution
            all over the world the maximum size a Fulgur can reach is expected to be around 200m.
            Fulgurs do not consume energy or reproduce. The materialize in a cloud and fight until they
            shrink to nothingness.</p>
