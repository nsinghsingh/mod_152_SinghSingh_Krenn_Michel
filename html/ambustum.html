        <p>An Ambustum (latin for burn) isn't actually an entity itself but
            more of a state of being. It is tipically a humanoid being
            in flames although cases whit an animal or even other paranormal creatures have been confirmed.
            The flames are orange and they can vary from burning brightly to almost extinguished.</p>
        <p>
            It is mostly peaceful but depending on how hungry
            it is, it may try to force any nearby people into giving him
            matter to feed on or to reproduce. On average Ambustum are up
            to 5x stronger version of the creature they resemble but that depends on how much they have grown. </p>

        <p class="info-title">Story</p>
        <p>We can assume that Ambustums weren't normally born as any other species but
            instead somehow were created by some unknown phenomenon and have then
            reproduced at a rather fast pace. As of today not many sightings are
            confirmed. This is probably because of how hard it is for an Ambustum
            to survive.</p>
        <p>
            A specimen is being kept safe at [redacted] and is being
            used to further learn about Ambustums. It has been made clear that
            all Ambustums have a goal but that has yet to be found out.</p>

        <p class="info-title">Species</p>
        <p>Ambustums are interesting because every single one of them are
            dead. It is assumed that the reason they are capable of moving has to
            do with paranormal forces. However this does not
            mean that they don't die. The moment that their flames go out, the body will
            go back to being a normal corpse. Otherwise only by completely destroying the body or freezing
            will they die.</p>
        <p>
            Their flames do not emit heat and they don't burn, instead they absorb the
            surrounding heat in order to grow bigger. The flames are the main source of power
            for Ambustums. With every movement and action a little bit of it is spent.
            As long as the temperature is above 5Â° C they will be capable of growing their flames.</p>
        <p>
            In order to reproduce they must find or produce a dead body and then merely touch it to
            pass the flame on. However non humanoid corpses can't sustain flames for very long and as
            such are rare to see.</p>
